## Mobitrice, a mobile version of Cockatrice

**What is this?**  
Mobitrice was initially going to be a UI/UX (user interface / experience) design proposal for how an app might look and work on a phone (first) and a tablet (second).
[Origin thread](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/issues/646) on [official Cockatrice Github page](https://cockatrice.github.io).

Began on [Sketch for Mac](https://sketch.com), moved to [Figma.com](https://figma.com) for UI wireframing. Began using [MIT Scratch](mit.scratch.com) for interactive concepts. Have (mostly) moved on to [Stencyl](https://stencyl.com) for it's deeper programmability and it's game-centric design & build tools. Objective for all chosen tools is in-browser use, so dev team has no friction to see and discuss interaction concepts (exporting to HTML5+JS Canvas interactive demos).  

**Difficulties**  
Cockatrice is designed with a desktop computer in mind. It requires a mouse/trackpad and relies on user actions such as *on hover*, *right-click*, and *click and drag*; those are just a few actions that are near-impossible on a phone (iOS or Android). I've had to use the existing Cockatrice interface as only a *suggestion* of what it should be and how it should work. The UX so far is similar, but still significantly different than its desktop counterpart.

**Timeframe**  
Unknown. The initial concept design of the most basic game features is needed; I'm a little way through that part. Other parts need to be designed such as login, connecting to a server, lobby actions, chat, friends list, etc. It's a *long* list.  
When should you expect a version of Cockatrice for your phone? Not soon, but at least the wheels are in (slow) motion.

**Moreâ€¦**  
This repo is an aggregator of ideas, concepts, wireframes, and documents I'm building for this project. I have no control over whether these are made into a real application, that's up to the official [Cockatrice dev team](https://cockatrice.github.io).

Built with MIT Scratch v3, viewable in your browser (Flash no longer needed!)

UX Wireframes coming soon.
